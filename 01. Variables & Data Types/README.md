# 1. Variables & Data Types

This folder contains Java programs and exercises focused on the basics of variables, data types, input/output, and simple computations. It is designed for beginners to understand foundational programming concepts in Java.

## Contents

- **Basics.java**  
  Boilerplate code template for starting Java programs.

- **output.java**  
  Demonstrates different ways to print output in Java using `System.out.print` and `System.out.println`.

- **PrintPattern.java**  
  Prints a simple pattern using multiple print statements.

- **sumAandB.java**  
  Calculates and prints the sum of two integers.

- **Q1.java**  
  Program to find the average of three numbers input by the user.

- **Q2.java**  
  Program to calculate the area of a square based on user input.

- **Q3.java**  
  Program to calculate the total cost of items (pencil, pen, eraser) entered by the user, and then compute the total price including GST (18%).

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Java files**  
   Open a terminal in this directory and run:
   javac <filename>.java
   Replace `<ClassName>` with the name of the class containing the `main` method.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand Java syntax and structure.
- Learn how to declare and use variables of different data types.
- Practice taking user input using `Scanner`.
- Perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Output results to the console.
- Work with simple programming exercises to reinforce concepts.

## Example Usage

**sumAandB.java**
Output: 64

**Q1.java**
Input: Enter 3 numbers: 10 20 30 Output: Average of 3 numbers is : 20.0

**Q2.java**
Input: Enter the side of Square: 5 Output: Area of Square is : 25

**Q3.java**
Input: Enter the cost of Items (pencil, pen, eraser): 5 10 15 Output: total price of the items : 30.0 and including gst : 35.4
