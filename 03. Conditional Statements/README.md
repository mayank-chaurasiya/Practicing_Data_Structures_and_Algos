# 3. Conditional Statements

This folder contains Java programs and exercises focused on conditional statements, including `if-else`, `switch-case`, and logical operators. These examples help beginners understand how to control program flow based on different conditions.

## Contents

- **calc.java**  
  A simple calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division based on user input and the chosen operator.

- **Income_Tax_Calc.java**  
  Calculates income tax based on user-provided income, using conditional statements to apply different tax rates.

- **largest_of_3.java**  
  Determines and prints the largest of three numbers entered by the user.

- **largestOf2.java**  
  Compares two numbers input by the user and prints which one is larger, smaller, or if they are equal.

- **Odd_Even.java**  
  Checks if a number entered by the user is odd or even.

- **practice_Q1.java**  
  Determines if a user-input number is positive, negative, or zero.

- **practice_Q2.java**  
  Checks if the user's body temperature indicates a fever (temperature â‰¥ 100).

- **practice_Q3.java**  
  Uses a switch-case statement to print the day of the week based on a number input (1-7).

- **practice_Q4.java**  
  Checks if a given year is a leap year using three different approaches: nested if-else, ternary operator, and logical operators.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Java files**  
   Open a terminal in this directory and run:
   javac <filename>.java
   Replace `<filename>` with the name of the file you want to compile.

2. **Run the compiled program**  
    java <ClassName>
    Replace `<ClassName>` with the name of the class containing the `main` method.
    
    ## Learning Objectives
    
    - Understand and use `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements.
    - Apply logical and comparison operators in decision-making.
    - Use `switch-case` for multi-way branching.
    - Practice handling user input and output.
    - Solve real-world problems using conditional logic.
    
    ## Example Usage
    
    **calc.java**
    Input: Enter A : 10 Enter B : 5 Enter operator : * Output: 50
        
    **Income_Tax_Calc.java**
    Input: Enter the amount : 600000 Output: your tax is : 120000
        
    **largest_of_3.java**
    Input: Enter num1 : 7 Enter num2 : 12 Enter num3 : 5 Output: 12 is greatest of all
        
    **Odd_Even.java**
    Input: Enter the number: 9 Output: 9 is odd
        
    **practice_Q4.java**
    Input: Enter the year (YYYY) : 2024 Output: 2024 a leap year true This is a leap year
